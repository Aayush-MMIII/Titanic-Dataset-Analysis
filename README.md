# Titanic Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset, investigating factors influencing survival rates among passengers. The dataset provides information on demographics, ticket class, fare, and other attributes of Titanic passengers, allowing us to explore patterns and insights into survival probabilities.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset to ensure data quality.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and summarizing the data to understand distributions, correlations, and trends.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
4. **Model Building**: Training predictive models to identify significant predictors of survival.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using relevant metrics and techniques such as cross-validation.
6. **Interpretation**: Interpreting model results to understand the factors affecting survival rates.
